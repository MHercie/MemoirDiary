# MemoryDiary

store daily entries with images.

Ignore the CSS and JS folders.

All the files are in the main view.

This is just the basic build.

Still to be done:
*More styling
*Error handling
*Adding emojis drop down menu to text area
*Filter on entry date
*Export all entries to pdf
*Add mood icons
*Reports on amount of use of specific moods
