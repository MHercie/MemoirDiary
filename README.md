# MemoryDiary

store daily entries with images.
This is a journal on one's daily emotions.

To capture and to analyze through a period of time, how one felt over a week, month or year.
Happy, sad, angry, depressed are all recorded so the user can view and even share.

If depressed or sad, or happy the user has the option so share that emotion entry on social media.
If the user is using a negative emotion too often, suggestions will be made to the user to seek professional help in their area.
A google map will display professionals in the area.


Ignore the CSS and JS folders.

All the files are in the main view.

This is just the basic build.

Still to be done:
*More styling
*Error handling
*Adding emojis drop down menu to text area
*Filter on entry date
*Add Google map
*Export all entries to pdf
*Add mood icons
*Reports on amount of use of specific moods
